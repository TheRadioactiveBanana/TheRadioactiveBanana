# Hello
## welcome to this random java programmer's bio
I am moderately depressed and program half the time and play osu and mindustry the other half the time.  
Sleeping schedule: nonexistent (3 am - 11am on weekends, 2:30am , 8am on weekdays if school, same scehdule as weekends if no tasks)
Autistic and has ADHD, and copious amounts of anxiety.

ps - do NOT dm me for osu or any game outside mindustry unless you already know me, never refer to me by my real name if you happen to know it.
